üè° Pune House Price Prediction
Welcome to the Pune House Price Prediction Tool! This web application uses machine learning to help users estimate house prices in Pune based on various features, such as location, size, and amenities. Whether you're buying or selling property, this tool provides accurate price predictions to guide your decisions.

üöÄ Features
1. User-Friendly Interface
A clean and intuitive form built with Flask for inputting house details effortlessly.

2. Dynamic Location Search
Quickly find and select desired locations within Pune through an intelligent dropdown.

3. Accurate Predictions
Powered by a robust machine learning model trained on real housing data for precise price estimates.

4. Responsive Design
Optimized for seamless use across devices, including mobile and desktop platforms.

üìä Machine Learning Model
The model is trained on an open-source dataset of Pune housing prices. It was initially built using Linear Regression but can be upgraded with advanced algorithms like Random Forests or XGBoost for better accuracy.

‚ú® Key Preprocessing Steps:
Converting mixed formats of square footage into a unified numeric value.
Handling missing values to ensure reliable predictions.
Encoding categorical data, such as location, for use in the model.
üß† How It Works
1. Input Features
Users provide details such as:

Number of Bedrooms
Total Area in Square Feet
Number of Bathrooms
Number of Balconies
Location within Pune
2. Predict Home Prices
Upon submission, the app processes the input through the trained model to calculate and display the predicted house price.

3. Smart Location Search
Effortlessly find your desired location with a dynamic search field.
